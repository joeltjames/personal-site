Fantasy Football Challenges is a Typescript/Angular application developed to allow fantasy football managers to quickly and easily determine the winner of various weekly challenges.

The code utilizes an ESPN API wrapper to retrieve data from the ESPN Fantasy Football API, and then calculates the winner of the selected challenge. Challenges range from simple, like "Most Points By Winner" to more complex like "Player Who Outscored Projection The Most".
