Meal Memo is a Typescript/Angular/NodeJS/Express application written to allow users to easily store recipes and make meal plans. This project is still a work in progress. There are many great recipe collection / meal planners available, but none quiet fit the needs that my wife and I have.

My goal with this project is to focus primarily on quick and easy meal planning, utilizing drag and drop interfaces and fast search. Meal plan length and "meals" should be fully customizable, as one user might wish to plan a month's worth of dinners, while another user might want to plan Breakfast/Lunch/Dinner for a week.

This app also helps fuel my self-hosting hobby by giving me another application to run on my home lab. The intention is that this project will be delivered via a Docker container that users can run on their own hardware.
