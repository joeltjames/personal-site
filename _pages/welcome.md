Welcome!

My name is J.T. James, and I am an Embedded Software Engineer working with some amazing people at [Syntech Systems](https://www.myfuelmaster.com/). I am currently working on creating an internal payment gateway to route payments to specific processors as necessary.

I am a full-stack developer, comfortable working on edge devices all the way up to the cloud. 

I love data analytics, especially sports data. Check out my [post on NFL injuries last season](https://joeltjames.github.io/nflInjury.html)!

I'd also love to hear from you! [Feel free to reach out via email!](mailto:joeltjames.com)
